Figure showing molocule pattern from an actual experiemnt as published in Nature Nanotechnology March 2012.
The paper describes how the concept of wave-particle duality is applied to predict how massive particles can produce interference patterns.
A feature of this experiment is that it shows how such patterns form one particle at a time.
A beam of molecules is produced by evaporation of a molecular coating by a laser. 
A 3Î¼m collimation slit produces a narrow beam. 
About 500mm from the collimation slit, the particles are incident on a grating with 100nm aperture spacing.
The scattered beam hits a target a further 560mm from the grating, where the molecules are illumated by an infrared laser. 
The infrared laser induces the depositied molecules to fluoresce, and the resulting pattern is imaged by a CCD camera.
